A simple 10 bit MIPI RAW image to YUV 420 NV12 and JPEG converter.
You need ffmpeg for creating jpg image from the YUV image. Please check any online site on how to install ffmpeg in your system.
As of now, the code will get compiled or executed only in GNU/Linux PCs, because of the usage of system command for JPEG convertion
I will be updating the code with my own JPEG encoder soon. Peace :D
A Raw image of my Yamaha C70 classical guitar is also attached.
If you are succesfull in making the YUV image and put it in suitable YUV image reader, you can see my guitar ;)
Or if you could make jpg image, you can open the same in any image viewer.
